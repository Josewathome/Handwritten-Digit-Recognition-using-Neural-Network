# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network Python
I have taken this a step further where our handwritten digit recognition system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits but also allows writing digits on the screen with the help of an integrated GUI for recognition.

## Approach 
We will approach this project by using a three-layered Neural Network. 

**The input layer**: It distributes the features of our examples to the next layer for calculation of activations of the next layer.
**The hidden layer**: They are made of hidden units called activations providing nonlinear ties for the network. A number of hidden layers can vary according to our requirements.
**The output layer**: The nodes here are called output units. It provides us with the final prediction of the Neural Network on the basis of which final predictions can be made.
